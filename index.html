    <h1>Info!</h1>

    <h2>It’s the one and only Etch A Sketch, 
        the classic drawing toy that’s been challenging 
        artists with its magic and mystery since 1960! 
        Use the mouse to create anything your imagination dreams up, 
        then give it a shake, shake, shake, using your mouse-wheel to erase and start all over 
        again.
    </h2>

    <h3>The Etch A Sketch was introduced near the peak of the 
        Baby Boom on 12 July 1960 for $2.99 (equivalent to $31 in 2023).
        It went on to sell 600,000 units that year and is one of the 
        best known toys of that era. In 1998, it was inducted into the 
        National Toy Hall of Fame at The Strong, in Rochester, New York. 
        In 2003, the Toy Industry Association named Etch A Sketch one of 
        the 100 most memorable toys of the 20th century. The Etch A Sketch 
        has since sold over 100 million units worldwide!
