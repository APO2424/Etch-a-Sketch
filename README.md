# Etch-a-Sketch
It’s the one and only Etch A Sketch, the classic drawing toy that’s been challenging artists with its magic and mystery since 1960! Use the mouse to create anything your imagination dreams up, then give it a shake, shake, shake, using your mouse-wheel to erase and start all over again.

Enter how many total squares you would like for your grid in the field box, then press enter to create your grid! Press Erase! to erase your grid and start all over again.
